# Metrics Dashboard

I told [Claude](https://claude.ai) that I wanted to track my efforts better. It coughed up this code and it seems like a good idea: Put everything in one spot so I can see if things are going in the right direction or not.

This whole project is probably really specific to me and my setup, so no guarantees that it will work for you.
